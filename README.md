# SQL-PIZZA-SALES-ANALYSTICS

## Project Overview

Welcome to the SQL Pizza Sales Analytics project! This project showcases the application of database management systems using SQL. The project is centered around analyzing pizza sales data imported from Excel sheets into MySQL Workbench. The database was constructed by writing codes and commands in the Query Bench to create tables. Following the creation of the tables, various problem statements were addressed, ranging from basic to advanced levels of complexity.
